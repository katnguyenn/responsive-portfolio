                  My name is Katherine and I am from Los Angeles, California. I have been in marketing for over four
                  years and have decided to transition into the tech industry. This decision came when I started my own
                  online business called Collective Vida, offering branding and website design. I quickly realized that 
                  utilizing the drag and drop function on most website building platforms was not enough to bring my vision
                  to the screen, so I learned to code HTML and CSS to help with this issue. Surprisingly, I found it very enjoyable
                  learning these langauges and decided to enroll in a program that would teach me even more.
                  <br>

                  Currently, I am a student at UCLA Extension Full Stack Development Bootcamp learning HTML, CSS, Javascript,
                   Node.js, React and more. I am super excited to continue developing my skills and my goal is to work at a clean
                  energy company as their software engineer.
